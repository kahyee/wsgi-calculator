"""
For your homework this week, you'll be creating a wsgi application of
your own.

You'll create an online calculator that can perform several operations.

You'll need to support:

  * Addition
  * Subtractions
  * Multiplication
  * Division

Your users should be able to send appropriate requests and get back
proper responses. For example, if I open a browser to your wsgi
application at `http://localhost:8080/multiple/3/5' then the response
body in my browser should be `15`.

Consider the following URL/Response body pairs as tests:

```
  http://localhost:8080/multiply/3/5   => 15
  http://localhost:8080/add/23/42      => 65
  http://localhost:8080/subtract/23/42 => -19
  http://localhost:8080/divide/22/11   => 2
  http://localhost:8080/               => <html>Here's how to use this page...</html>
```

To submit your homework:

  * Fork this repository (Session03).
  * Edit this file to meet the homework requirements.
  * Your script should be runnable using `$ python calculator.py`
  * When the script is running, I should be able to view your
    application in my browser.
  * I should also be able to see a home page (http://localhost:8080/)
    that explains how to perform calculations.
  * Commit and push your changes to your fork.
  * Submit a link to your Session03 fork repository!
